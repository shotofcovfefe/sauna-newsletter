Gentle movement and deep breathing create a sense of lightness and ease in the body.\nWe incorporate the sauna and cold plunges to support nervous system regulation, building resilience and helping the mind settle into presence.\nThe practice closes with sound therapy using crystal singing bowls \u2014 designed to shift brainwaves, promote relaxation, and leave you feeling grounded, clear, and deeply connected.",

We'll also drink specially brewed tea. \n\nEach element is introduced gently, allowing time for rest, integration, and connection.\n\nThis session is ideal if you:\n\nAre curious about banya or guided sauna rituals\n\nEnjoy sensory, ritual-led experiences\n\nWant something nurturing, grounding, and communal\n\nAre looking for a slower, more intentional sauna experience",

              "level": "Join us for a unique evening combining the joy of singing with the relaxation of sauna. \n\nThis special session brings together sauna ritual and singing meditation - two powerful practices for grounding the body, calming the nervous system, and creating connection.\n\nWe\u2019ll begin with 40 minutes in the sauna, allowing heat, steam and stillness to help you soften, slow down, and arrive fully in your body. After cooling and settling, we\u2019ll transition into 40 minutes of Singing Meditation, led live from the keyboard by Jacob, founder of Singing Meditation.\n\nJacob is a professional musician and daily meditator who discovered that singing can be one of the most accessible ways to deepen presence and focus - no prior meditation or musical experience required.\n\nUsing a simple call-and-response format, Jacob guides the group through gentle songs and mantras, building two- and three-part harmonies organically. There\u2019s no sheet music, no pressure, and no \u201cright\u201d way to participate. You\u2019re invited to:\n\nSing the main melody\nExplore harmonies or improvisation\nOr simply listen and absorb the sound\n\nAt the heart of this session is choice, accessibility, and shared calm. Whether you sing or stay quiet, sound becomes a meditative tool, something you can lean into, rather than perform.\n\nThis is a warm, inclusive space designed to help you drop out of your head, reconnect with your breath, and experience rest through rhythm and resonance.\n\nNo singing experience needed.\nJust come as you are.",

Contrast exposure sharpens awareness, boosts adaptability, and creates a clear reset for both body and mind.\n\nExpect to feel more spacious in your body, calm, clear, and grounded in your natural, baseline nervous system. \n\nNo experience needed.

Contrast exposure sharpens awareness, boosts adaptability, and creates a clear reset for both body and mind.\n\nExpect to feel more spacious in your body, calm, clear, and grounded in your natural, baseline nervous system. \n\nNo experience needed.

We'll also drink specially brewed tea. \n\nEach element is introduced gently, allowing time for rest, integration, and connection.\n\nThis session is ideal if you:\n\nAre curious about banya or guided sauna rituals\n\nEnjoy sensory, ritual-led experiences\n\nWant something nurturing, grounding, and communal\n\nAre looking for a slower, more intentional sauna experience",

After cooling and settling, we\u2019ll transition into 40 minutes of Singing Meditation, led live from the keyboard by Jacob, founder of Singing Meditation.\n\nJacob is a professional musician and daily meditator who discovered that singing can be one of the most accessible ways to deepen presence and focus - no prior meditation or musical experience required.\n\nUsing a simple call-and-response format, Jacob guides the group through gentle songs and mantras, building two- and three-part harmonies organically. There\u2019s no sheet music, no pressure, and no \u201cright\u201d way to participate. You\u2019re invited to:\n\nSing the main melody\nExplore harmonies or improvisation\nOr simply listen and absorb the sound\n\nAt the heart of this session is choice, accessibility, and shared calm. Whether you sing or stay quiet, sound becomes a meditative tool, something you can lean into, rather than perform.\n\nThis is a warm, inclusive space designed to help you drop out of your head, reconnect with your breath, and experience rest through rhythm and resonance.\n\nNo singing experience needed.\nJust come as you are.",

Contrast exposure sharpens awareness, boosts adaptability, and creates a clear reset for both body and mind.\n\nExpect to feel more spacious in your body, calm, clear, and grounded in your natural, baseline nervous system. \n\nNo experience needed.

Contrast exposure sharpens awareness, boosts adaptability, and creates a clear reset for both body and mind.\n\nExpect to feel more spacious in your body, calm, clear, and grounded in your natural, baseline nervous system. \n\nNo experience needed.

We'll also drink specially brewed tea. \n\nEach element is introduced gently, allowing time for rest, integration, and connection.\n\nThis session is ideal if you:\n\nAre curious about banya or guided sauna rituals\n\nEnjoy sensory, ritual-led experiences\n\nWant something nurturing, grounding, and communal\n\nAre looking for a slower, more intentional sauna experience",

After cooling and settling, we\u2019ll transition into 40 minutes of Singing Meditation, led live from the keyboard by Jacob, founder of Singing Meditation.\n\nJacob is a professional musician and daily meditator who discovered that singing can be one of the most accessible ways to deepen presence and focus - no prior meditation or musical experience required.\n\nUsing a simple call-and-response format, Jacob guides the group through gentle songs and mantras, building two- and three-part harmonies organically. There\u2019s no sheet music, no pressure, and no \u201cright\u201d way to participate. You\u2019re invited to:\n\nSing the main melody\nExplore harmonies or improvisation\nOr simply listen and absorb the sound\n\nAt the heart of this session is choice, accessibility, and shared calm. Whether you sing or stay quiet, sound becomes a meditative tool, something you can lean into, rather than perform.\n\nThis is a warm, inclusive space designed to help you drop out of your head, reconnect with your breath, and experience rest through rhythm and resonance.\n\nNo singing experience needed.\nJust come as you are.",

Contrast exposure sharpens awareness, boosts adaptability, and creates a clear reset for both body and mind.\n\nExpect to feel more spacious in your body, calm, clear, and grounded in your natural, baseline nervous system. \n\nNo experience needed.

We'll also drink specially brewed tea. \n\nEach element is introduced gently, allowing time for rest, integration, and connection.\n\nThis session is ideal if you:\n\nAre curious about banya or guided sauna rituals\n\nEnjoy sensory, ritual-led experiences\n\nWant something nurturing, grounding, and communal\n\nAre looking for a slower, more intentional sauna experience",

After cooling and settling, we\u2019ll transition into 40 minutes of Singing Meditation, led live from the keyboard by Jacob, founder of Singing Meditation.\n\nJacob is a professional musician and daily meditator who discovered that singing can be one of the most accessible ways to deepen presence and focus - no prior meditation or musical experience required.\n\nUsing a simple call-and-response format, Jacob guides the group through gentle songs and mantras, building two- and three-part harmonies organically. There\u2019s no sheet music, no pressure, and no \u201cright\u201d way to participate. You\u2019re invited to:\n\nSing the main melody\nExplore harmonies or improvisation\nOr simply listen and absorb the sound\n\nAt the heart of this session is choice, accessibility, and shared calm. Whether you sing or stay quiet, sound becomes a meditative tool, something you can lean into, rather than perform.\n\nThis is a warm, inclusive space designed to help you drop out of your head, reconnect with your breath, and experience rest through rhythm and resonance.\n\nNo singing experience needed.\nJust come as you are.",
