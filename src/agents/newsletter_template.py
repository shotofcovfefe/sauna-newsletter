# The London Sauna: date Month - date Month

## 30 second rundown

Write 3–5 sentences max. This should feel like “what changed in the scene + what it means” rather than a list.
- Include 2–4 concrete movements: opening, closure, reopening, expansion, access change, pricing model shift, major programme launch.
- Another succinct but readable part about what else is covered in this newsletter. 
- End with one clear takeaway sentence.

Example shape:
A, B, C happened. We found X interesting this week. Net takeaway: Y. If you do one thing this week, do Z.

Split into sub sections 
### 🏆 Sauna session of the week

for `### 🏆 Sauna session of the week` and `### 🥈 Runner up` it should be structured like so. 
```
📍 Name of sauna

[Name of session](https://www.insertlink.com/event-booking-page) text describing the session.
```

`### Noteworthy mentions` will be more succinct. You can add several sessions, with structure like so.
```
<demonstrative emoji> [Name of sauna / venue](www.insertlink.com/to/booking/page): description of event
```

---

## The Take

One coherent point of view that connects the week’s news.
Guidelines:

# META RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- **Opinionated ≠ careless**: be sharp, but factual.
- **Fewer items, more judgement**.
- **Never pretend certainty you don’t have** — label ambiguity.
- **Assume the reader is smart, busy, and allergic to hype**.
- **Don’t repeat yourself** too much! It's fine to in the 30s rundown and later. But not like, sauna news + events + spotlight for instance. 
- **Tasteful emojis** are welcome, but never inline text only at the start of a section / paragraph.

CRITICAL RULE
- MUST BE ACCURATE. Do not make up information. 
- Make sure to use the input information that you've been given, do not make things up becaues they sound good. They must be REAL, and "real" means was in the set of information / news / events candidates given to you. Nothing else.

# The London Sauna

Tue 27 Jan 2026

[insert image: fogged glass door, warm light behind it]

## 30 second rundown

New venue soft-launching in Deptford, a meaningful reopen that might fix crowding, one venue pausing indefinitely, and a shift toward members-first access at another. Net takeaway: the scene is maturing, which usually means less spontaneity and more gatekeeping.

If you do one thing this week, try Rivergate during soft launch. It’s the rare moment when a new venue is both interesting and still gettable.

---

## Sauna news

🧘‍♀️ [Rivergate Sauna](https://www.insertlink.com/rivergate) has quietly soft-launched in Deptford. It looks like a proper build, not a pop-up, and the early window is when it’s easiest to form your own opinion before it becomes “a thing”.

📬 [Old Street Steam](https://www.insertlink.com/old-street-steam) has reopened after a refurb that changes capacity rather than just surfaces. They’ve added a second hot room and expanded the cold area. If it reduces the peak crush, it’s effectively a different venue.

⤵️ [Borough Heat Hut](https://www.insertlink.com/borough-heat-hut) is paused indefinitely in their wording. In London that often means a reset, a move, or a quiet end. Either way, it’s off the map for now.

🙋‍♂️ [Ironhouse Sauna](https://www.insertlink.com/ironhouse-sauna) has introduced a members-first release window. That is not a small tweak. It changes who gets access and how reliable the venue is if you’re not inside the membership lane.

## Events of the week

### 🏆 Sauna session of the week

📍 Arcade Bermondsey

[Post Dusk sessions](https://www.insertlink.com/arcade-sauna/post-dusk-night) running Friday and Saturday nights with late slots at 18:45, 19:00, and 19:30. The evening crowd skews younger and stays longer than the lunchtime rush. Worth trying if you’ve only been during office hours.

### 🥈 Runner up

📍 Community Aufgass, Camberwell

[Silent Sunrise sessions](https://www.communityaufgassinsertlink.com/event-booking-page) launching February 7th at 7:00 AM on weekends. Early, quiet, no talking. For people who want the heat without the social layer.

### Noteworthy mentions

🎶 [Community Sauna Baths, Walthamstow](www.insertlink.com/to/booking/page): Jon Hopkins x Saunathesia on February 4th. A curated session built around Hopkins’ music, which is about as close to a headline event as the sauna scene gets. This will book out. If you want it, move now.

🧖‍♀️ Banya No.1, Hoxton](www.insertlink.com/to/booking/page): Lithuanian Pirtis Ritual on February 8th. Traditional Baltic steam work with a focus on technique and ritual. If you’ve done the standard banya sessions and want something more specific, this is the deeper cut.

🏳️‍⚧️ Sauna Social Club, Peckham](www.insertlink.com/to/booking/page): Trans Sauna session on January 23rd with slot-based access from 7:30 PM. Dedicated sessions like this remain one of the better things the London scene does. Specific ticket tiers for Black people and people of colour.

😌 [Canal Yard Sauna](www.insertlink.com/to/booking/page): Sound and sweat session. Guided heat rounds with a live sound bath in the cooldown window. If that sounds like nonsense to you, skip it. If you like structure and a bit of theatre, it is usually a good night.

## The Take - A Sauna Culture Moment

London sauna is entering a more institutional phase. You can see it in a single week of news: a new venue arrives with a real build, an older venue reinvests in capacity, a small operator pauses indefinitely, and another venue moves toward membership-gated access.

That pattern usually means two things.

First, the middle of the market gets squeezed. Casual, lightly-capitalised venues struggle when rents, staffing, and energy costs bite, while better-funded places either expand or formalise access to protect revenue.

Second, spontaneity gets priced out. Membership-first releases are the clearest signal of where the scene goes next: fewer “I’ll see what’s available”, more “I’m in the system or I’m not”. If you like sauna as a casual habit, the practical adaptation is boring but real: decide which venues you want to be loyal to, and ignore the rest.

## Venue Spotlight: Old Street Steam

who it’s for: hip yuppies looking to socialise

[insert image: benches, soft steam, no faces]

Old Street Steam has always been easy to recommend with a caveat. Central, dependable, does the basics. Then the caveat: at peak it could feel like wellness in traffic, with the calm replaced by crowd management.

The refurb is interesting because it targets the caveat rather than polishing the brand. A second hot room and a larger cold zone is a direct attempt to ease congestion. If the flow now feels calmer, Old Street Steam shifts from occasional option to genuinely repeatable venue. If it still feels crushed at the wrong times, the verdict stays the same, just with nicer surfaces.

If you’re deciding whether to go back, don’t overthink it. Go once at a sensible time and ask a blunt question: does it feel like a circuit, or a queue.

## Reading Corner

**Sauna Use and Cardiovascular Health: New Meta-Analysis**

A comprehensive review of 15 studies examining regular sauna use and heart health outcomes over 5+ years. Methodologically sound, controls for exercise confounding, and quantifies risk reduction. Worth reading if you want the science without the wellness-industrial spin.
